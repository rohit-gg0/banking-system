# Banking System (Python)

A console-based banking system built in Python to model real-world banking concepts such as money handling, accounts, transactions, currency conversion, and persistence.

This project focuses on **clean domain modeling**, **error handling**, and **incremental system design**, rather than UI or frameworks.

---

## Features Implemented

### Money & Currency
- `Money` class using **integer minor units only** (no floating-point storage)
- Strong currency typing using `Enum`
- Currency comparison safety (no cross-currency arithmetic)
- Hashable money objects
- Currency conversion via a centralized `CurrencyConverter`
  - Explicit rounding to maintain integer invariants

---

### Accounts
- Abstract `Account` base class
- Implemented account types:
  - **Savings Account**
    - Enforces minimum balance (bank-defined)
  - **Current Account**
    - Supports overdraft (bank-defined)
- Strict currency enforcement per account
- Custom errors for:
  - Insufficient funds
  - Invalid deposits
  - Invalid withdrawals

---

### Bank
- Central authority managing:
  - Account creation
  - Deposits, withdrawals, transfers
  - Currency conversion
- Account IDs auto-generated by the bank
- Bank-controlled rules:
  - Minimum balance
  - Overdraft limits
- Password management per account (stored inside the bank)
- Persistent storage using `pickle`

---

### Authentication
- Account-level password protection
- Limited retry attempts

---

### Transactions
- Successful transactions are recorded using `Transaction`
- Failed attempts are recorded separately using `TransactionAttempt`
- Supported transaction types:
  - Deposit
  - Withdraw
  - Transfer
- Each transaction stores:
  - Type
  - Amount
  - Timestamp
  - Involved account(s)

---

### Transaction History
- Per-account transaction history
- Includes:
  - Successful transactions
  - Failed transaction attempts
- Transfers appear in the history of **both sender and receiver**

---

### CLI (Current State)
- **User-only CLI implemented**
- Supported operations:
  1. Check balance
  2. Withdraw funds
  3. Deposit funds
  4. Transfer funds
  5. Open savings account
  6. Open current account
  7. View transaction history
  8. Exit

>  **Admin CLI is planned but not implemented yet**

---

## Design Philosophy

- Money is always handled safely using integers
- Business rules live inside domain objects (not the CLI)
- Bank acts as the single source of truth
- Errors are explicit and meaningful
- Failed operations are first-class citizens (not ignored)

This project intentionally prioritizes **clarity and correctness over shortcuts**.
